Attackers can use the data held within AD to learn a great deal about an organization. On top of that, with the threats of Golden Tickets, malicious destruction, or simple unauthorized access into confidential data, protecting Active Directory is something that must be taken seriously. This session will cover a handful of security enhancements that are easily implemented yet appear to be rarely used, even by some security conscious entities.

Open sourced by Facebook in 2015, GraphQL is a declarative API that provides a great deal of flexibility and optimization gains. This allows for new features to be rolled out very quickly without necessarily a lot of back end changes. Its agile aspect lends itself well to teams following the principles of continuous integration and deployment. For these reasons GraphQL is likely to see increased adoption through the industry in the coming years, likely to rival REST APIs. What does the threat landscape look like for GraphQL APIs? What potential pitfalls might a developer encounter? How does an organization effectively secure a GraphQL?</p><p>http://bit.ly/2Oxp5Bp</p><p>https://slides.com/mmoses/deck/live</p><img alt="Totally awesome QR code" src="images/QR.png" width="200"></div><!-- The dumb CSS requires this...? --><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"> </ul></div><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><h3 class="bold">Panel Round 1</h3><h3>Moss vs Lawlz</h3><h4>Exhibit Hall B</h4><br><p>It's gonna get weird.</p></div><!-- The dumb CSS requires this...? --><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"> </ul></div><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><h3 class="bold">Can we protect privacy without breaking the web?</h3><h3>Luke Crouch</h3><h4>Room 3</h4><br><p>Privacy, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, Cookies, oh my!</p></div><!-- The dumb CSS requires this...? --><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"> </ul></div><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><h3 class="bold">ICS</h3><h3>Pedro Serrano</h3><h4>Room 4</h4><br><p>Coming soon!</p></div><!-- The dumb CSS requires this...? --><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"></ul></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>Lightning Talks 1:30pm-1:55pm</time></div><div class="schedule-slot"><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><h3 class="bold">Defending and Responding to Business E-Mail Compromises within Office 365</h3><h3>Michael Oglesby & Jenna Waters</h3><h4>True Digital Security</h4><h4>Exhibit Hall A</h4><br><p>A discussion of Office 365 incident response and forensics capabilities, security features, and how security teams can effectively utilize these resources.</p><p>Business E-mail Compromises (BEC) are increasingly becoming a significant cause of data breaches and financial loss.

This impacts all kinds of weird things, like how you handle laptops or how scared or comfortable you should be with cloud computing.</p><p>UEFI is a spec defining interactions between low-level computer firmware (the stuff you think of as your BIOS) and all the other computers in their little computer village. Technically, UEFI runs on your normal processor, but at runtime it shares the processor with your OS, and for most purposes you can think of it as a co-processor running in parallel.</p><p>The BMC is an actual co-processor (often ARM-based, or SH4 on older servers) that allows you to manage the server remotely. It has multiple devices exposed to the host, web servers, and lots of complex, network services running as root.</p><p>In this talk, we’ll cover the attack surface of these two components on modern systems, how to assess them if you are so inclined, and how they should inform your decisions when planning data center deployments and cloud server usage. We’ll release initial versions of Binary Ninja plugins we’ve been working on at Atredis, bringing UEFI coverage to the new platform and its hot MLIL, and who knows, we might drop 0day or a post exploitation framework if we get around to it.</p></div><!-- The dumb CSS requires this...? --><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"> </ul></div><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><h3 class="bold">Cyber Patriot Panel</h3><h3>Julio Tirado</h3><h4>Cyber Patriot Tulsa</h4><h4>Exhibit Hall B</h4><br><p>Recruiting the next generation into information security roles is a priority.
