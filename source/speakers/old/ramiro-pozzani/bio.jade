| Ramiro first started working for Accenture doing Business Intelligence tasks, then I move on to RSA where I was on the first Latin America team devoted to fight online fraud and others criminals activities. We created some really interesting stuff (our Boleto Malware report was something that our Minister of Justice had to give a statement about). There I had the idea to create this talk, I was trying to answer "how many people are really scammed by phishing", and eventually this evolved to a more complete understand of the cyber crime area.
