        h3.bold Quick Wins To Enhance Your Active Directory Security
        h3 Eric Kuehn
        h4 Secure Ideas
        h4 Exhibit Hall A
        br
        p Active Directory environments are typically the lifeblood of every company; acting as the core authentication and authorization source. Attackers can use the data held within AD to learn a great deal about an organization. On top of that, with the threats of Golden Tickets, malicious destruction, or simple unauthorized access into confidential data, protecting Active Directory is something that must be taken seriously. This session will cover a handful of security enhancements that are easily implemented yet appear to be rarely used, even by some security conscious entities. This will include not only the changes to these common misconfigurations but also some readily available methods that exploit them.

        h3 Jason Gillam
        h4 Secure Ideas
        h4 Exhibit Hall B
        br
        p I have been building tools and extensions to support penetration testing tasks for many years, and am most known for my work on Burp CO2 and Paramalyzer. This talk is meant to pass on knowledge of how to make use of extensions and also set the foundation for building them. Through a series of demonstrations I intend to show some of my current work as well as that of other extension developers. All of the extensions demonstrated during this talk are open source projects, and I hope to inspire more open source contributions to information security tool projects. For this talk my demonstrations will be specific to Burp Suite, the proxy tool familiar to web application penetration testers, but they will be applicable in other contexts.
        p This is a technical talk and is most appropriate for anyone who is at least dabbling in software development or who is familiar with web application penetration testing.

        h4 Room 4
        br
        p Even though there are no rock stars in InfoSec, we can use classic rock as a road map for information security. Join me as we count down top classic rock songs, break down the barriers we all face, and explore the lessons we never knew they taught us. I promise, I won’t be singing!
        p Whether you’re dealing with “Proud Mary” in Payroll (who would never admit they fell for a phishing email) or “Me & Bobby McGee” in the warehouse, Information Security has plenty of challenges. It’s not always best to be the “Iron Man” and lock everything down so nobody can work. “Welcome to the Jungle” and I’ll share some tips to keep you “Rockin’ in the Free World”. So, who else thinks of their disaster recovery plan every time they hear “Smoke on the Water”?

        h3.bold The Next Generation of APIs - GraphQL and its Security Landscape
        h3 Matthew Moses
        h4 Exhibit Hall A
        br
        br
        p The popularity of GraphQL APIs is on the rise. Open sourced by Facebook in 2015, GraphQL is a declarative API that provides a great deal of flexibility and optimization gains. This allows for new features to be rolled out very quickly without necessarily a lot of back end changes. Its agile aspect lends itself well to teams following the principles of continuous integration and deployment. For these reasons GraphQL is likely to see increased adoption through the industry in the coming years, likely to rival REST APIs. What does the threat landscape look like for GraphQL APIs? What potential pitfalls might a developer encounter? How does an organization effectively secure a GraphQL?

        h4 Exhibit Hall A
        br
        p A discussion of Office 365 incident response and forensics capabilities, security features, and how security teams can effectively utilize these resources.
        p Business E-mail Compromises (BEC) are increasingly becoming a significant cause of data breaches and financial loss. Many companies are falling victim to mass phishing and credential harvesting attacks giving attackers access to internal email communications and sensitive private data. Compounding the issues are more and more organizations are moving their email into the cloud, using services such as Office 365. An organization’s ability to defend and respond to a breach within a cloud email environment requires planning and forethought. This talk will provide guidance, tools, and tips when performing cloud-based incident response within a typical Office 365 environment. A discussion of Office 365 incident response and forensics capabilities, security features, and how security teams can effectively utilize these resources will be presented.

        h3.bold UEFI, BMC, and the Gremlins Therein
        h3 Nathan Keltner
        h4 Atredis
        h4 Exhibit Hall A
        br
        p Your modern computer is a matryoshka doll of computers, computers inside computers, and it’s also turtles all the way down. This impacts all kinds of weird things, like how you handle laptops or how scared or comfortable you should be with cloud computing.
        p UEFI is a spec defining interactions between low-level computer firmware (the stuff you think of as your BIOS) and all the other computers in their little computer village. Technically, UEFI runs on your normal processor, but at runtime it shares the processor with your OS, and for most purposes you can think of it as a co-processor running in parallel.
        p The BMC is an actual co-processor (often ARM-based, or SH4 on older servers) that allows you to manage the server remotely. It has multiple devices exposed to the host, web servers, and lots of complex, network services running as root.
        p In this talk, we’ll cover the attack surface of these two components on modern systems, how to assess them if you are so inclined, and how they should inform your decisions when planning data center deployments and cloud server usage. We’ll release initial versions of Binary Ninja plugins we’ve been working on at Atredis, bringing UEFI coverage to the new platform and its hot MLIL, and who knows, we might drop 0day or a post exploitation framework if we get around to it.

        p Incident response is a technical process by nature, but do you know how to develop and incident response program that’s appropriate for your organization’s level of maturity and get buy in from your business leaders? In this talk I will cover how to determine your organizations maturity by using the capability maturity model and how to implement the PICERL model (prepare, identify contain, eradicate, recover, and lessons learned) to handle an incident. I’ll wrap up the talk by covering how to sell this program to your business leaders and how to prepare a business case to justify it.

        h3 Ian Anderson
        h4 Room 4
        br
        p Most people assume challenges in information security are of a technical type, but the challenges Enterprise Defenders typically face are relational and/or political. So, it makes sense that some of the most critical work that Information Security professionals can undertake is creating the relational infrastructure that enables them to get things done within their organization.
        p Developing and maintaining effective relationships, especially with executives, finance/budget, supply chain, and field personnel is a critical component of every effective Enterprise Security Program. Without these relationships in place, disconnects between perception and intent will hinder your efforts to accomplish your goals. This talk covers some of the other teams that defenders may encounter, how these teams perceive cybersecurity, and how best to establish a productive relationship with them. Attendees should walk away with a couple of quick hitter ideas on how to establish or reconnect with various segments of a business.
        p We all have jobs to do and a method for how we work. Defenders that understand how business units work, and what these business units can offer back to the blue team, will be able to develop more effective and efficient strategies that align with business efforts., AKA: we can get more stuff done…
